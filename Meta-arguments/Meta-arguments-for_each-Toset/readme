# Terraform (toset) function
'toset' function convert its argument to a set value. In short, it does a explicit type   conversion to normalize the types.
# Note : 
Terraform's concept of a set requires all of the elements to be of the same type, mixed-typed elements will be converted to the most general type.

Set collections are unordered and cannot contain duplicate values, so the ordering of the argument elements is lost and any duplicate values are coalesced.
