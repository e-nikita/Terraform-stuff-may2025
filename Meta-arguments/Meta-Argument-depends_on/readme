# depends_on Meta-Argument

The "depends_on" meta-argument establishes dependencies between resources that do not directly reference one another. Use the depends_on argument to explicitly set the order in which Terraform creates resources.

example :

Here we will create public ip with depends_on argument with virtual network and subnet.

1. Public IP Resource will get created only afer Virtual Network and Subnet Resource got created.
2. As we have defined explicit dependency `depends_on` in Public IP Resource, it will wait till those two other resources got created. 
3. Important Point to remember is "Explicitly specifying a dependency is only necessary when a resource or module relies on some other resource's behavior but doesn't access any of that resource's data in its arguments."
