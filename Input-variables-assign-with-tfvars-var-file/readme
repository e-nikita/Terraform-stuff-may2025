# Terraform Input Variables using -var-file Argument
***************
Introduction :
# Input variables using <any-name>.tfvars file with CLI argument -var-file.
# If we plan to use different names for .tfvars files, then we need to explicitly
 provide the argument -var-file during the terraform plan or apply.
# We will use following things in this example
 terraform.tfvars: All other common variables will be picked from this file and environment
 specific files will be picked from specific env.tfvars files.
 dev.tfvars: environment and resoure_group_location variable will be picked from this file
 qa.tfvars: environment and resoure_group_location variable will be picked from this file
